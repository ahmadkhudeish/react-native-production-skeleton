# React Native Production App Template

This template can be used to get started with developing a new React Native app without having to go through the installation steps again.
I assume that you have already got your environment setup to run React Native apps, if not you can have a look at this link to get started https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html

# Install

Run the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/ahmadkhudeish/react-native-production-skeleton.git`
`cd react-native-production-skeleton`
`yarn install`

To run on Android:
`yarn run android`

To run on iOS:
`yarn run ios`
